# 📐 Vector Angle Calculator

This Python program calculates the **cosine of the angle (θ)** between two 2D vectors **A** and **B**, as well as the angle **θ in degrees**.

## 📝 Description
The program takes input values for the components of two vectors:  
- **A (a1, a2)**  
- **B (b1, b2)**  

It then calculates:  
The **cosine of the angle (costh)** between the vectors using the dot product formula:
   
  

Where: 



## 🚀 Usage
1. Run the script in Python.
2. Enter the values when prompted.
3. View the calculated cosine and angle.
